# My Python Math Operations Project

This project includes Python scripts for basic math operations (addition and multiplication) along with GitHub Actions workflows for testing each operation.

## Addition

The `addition.py` script provides a simple function for addition and a corresponding test file.

### Running Tests for Addition

To run the tests for addition, you can use the following GitHub Actions workflow:

- Workflow file: [.github/workflows/addition-action.yml](.github/workflows/addition-action.yml)

This workflow is triggered on each push to the repository.

## Multiplication

The `multiplication.py` script provides a simple function for multiplication and a corresponding test file.

### Running Tests for Multiplication

To run the tests for multiplication, you can use the following GitHub Actions workflow:

- Workflow file: [.github/workflows/multiplication-action.yml](.github/workflows/multiplication-action.yml)

This workflow is triggered on each push to the repository.
